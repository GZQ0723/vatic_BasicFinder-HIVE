This document will describe how to modify VATIC for your own purposes. If you
only want to use VATIC, please see README instead.

VATIC is actually broken up into three different packages:

    1. vatic - video annotation tool
    2. turkic - a platform for easy MTurk management
    3. pyvision - a simple Python computer vision toolkit

In general, you likely want to only modify VATIC, which houses the essential
tools for video annotation, such as: the JavaScript video player, instructions,
entire user interface, merging paths, quality assurance, etc.

pyvision contains a couple of routines useful for vision research (e.g.,
convolution, tracking, svm, bounding boxes). You probably should only modify
pyvision if you want to tweak our tracking algorithms, linear interpolation
schemes, or support new type of annotations besides bounding boxes.

turkic is a framework that makes it easy to send jobs to MTurk. It manages
workers, payment, and training. You probably should only modify turkic if you
want to change protocols to how workers are paid and quality control is done.

More to come later...
